      <p>
        Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or
        alongside humans. For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to
        utter their names. There are currently more than 700 creatures that
        inhabit the Pokémon universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called “Trainers”).
        During their adventures, Pokémon grow, level up and become more
        experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are over a dozen different types of Pokémon, such as Fire type,
        Psychic type, and Dragon type. Every Pokémon type comes with both
        advantages as well as disadvantages when battling different Pokémon
        types.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a Fire type Pokémon has the edge against Grass type
        Pokémon, but will be at a disadvantage against Water type Pokémon. This
        makes strategic thinking, positioning and use of the Pokémon in your
        team a crucial part of battles.
